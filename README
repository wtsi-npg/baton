baton |bəˈtän|

  noun, A short stick or staff or something resembling one.

Client programs and API for use with iRODS (Integrated Rule-Oriented
Data System).


Installation:

Install iRODS and baton dependencies (Jansson and zlog) as described
in their documentation. iRODS does not install its headers and
libraries in the standard locations, therefore you should set the
environment variable IRODS_HOME to the root of your iRODS
installation before executing the following commands.

# Use IRODS_HOME to set CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS for compilation
source set_irods_home.sh

# Generate the configure script
autoreconf -i

# Generate the makefiles (see INSTALL for arguments to configure)
./configure

# Compile
make

# Optionally, run the test suite
make check

# Install
make install
