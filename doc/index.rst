Welcome to ``baton``'s documentation
====================================

baton \|bəˈtän|
   *noun, A short stick or staff or something resembling one.*

Client programs and API for use with `iRODS <http://www.irods.org>`_
(Integrated Rule-Oriented Data System).

``baton`` is intended as a supplement to the command line client
programs (``ils``, ``imeta`` etc.) provided with a standard iRODS
installation. Its provides the following features not included in
iRODS:

* A single JSON format for listing results, composing queries and
  performing updates.

* Listing of data objects and collections as JSON, including their
  metadata (AVUs), file size, replicates, checksums, access control
  lists (ACLs) and creation and modification timestamps.

* Queries on metadata, on access control lists (ACLs), creation and
  modification timestamps and timestamp ranges. The full range of
  iRODS query operators is supported.

* Uploading local files to create data objects.

* Fetching data object content inlined within JSON (text files only)
  or downloading data objects to local files.

* Unbuffered option for IPC via pipes with fine-grained error
  reporting for batch operations.

* Simplified API over the iRODS general query API to ease construction
  of new custom queries.

* Automatic release of iRODS connections when idle (see the ``--connect-time``
  command line option).

Obtaining and installing ``baton``
==================================

``baton`` may be downloaded as source code from its `GitHub homepage
<http://github.com/wtsi-npg/baton.git/>`_ . It is written using the
iRODS C API and requires a C compiler to build.

1. Install iRODS and the `Jansson JSON library
   <http://www.digip.org/jansson/>`_ ) as described in their
   documentation.

2. Generate the configure script. If you download a release tar.gz
   archive, you may skip this step because the configure script is
   included.

.. code-block:: sh

   autoreconf -i

3. Generate the makefiles (see INSTALL for arguments to configure).
   iRODS may be installed from OS packages or from source.

.. code-block:: sh

   LDFLAGS="-Wl,-z,muldefs" ./configure


   If you have iRODS headers and libraries installed in a non-standard
   place, you will need to set the CPPFLAGS and LDFLAGS environmment
   variables appropriately.

.. code-block:: sh

   CPPFLAGS="-I/path/to/irods/headers" \
     LDFLAGS="-Wl,-z,muldefs -L/path/to/irods/libraries" ./configure


4. Compile

.. code-block:: sh

   make

5.  Optionally, run the test suite

.. code-block:: sh

   make check

6. If you have run configure with the optional --enable-coverage flag
   you can generate test coverage statistics with lcov.

.. code-block:: sh

   make check-coverage

7. Install, including HTML manual and manpage.

.. code-block:: sh

   make clean install


The ``baton`` suite of programs
===============================

``baton`` comprises several command-line programs, all of which accept
a stream of JSON objects on standard input (or from a file) and emit a
stream of JSON objects on standard output i.e.

.. code-block:: sh

   { object 1 }  { object 2 }  ...  { object n }


The JSON stream may be in a single file (the filename given on the
command line using the ``--file`` option) or in multiple files
concatenated on ``STDIN``. Any whitespace between the JSON objects is
ignored.


The ``baton`` programs are:

* `baton-chmod`_

  Modify the access control lists of collections and data objects.

* `baton-get`_

  Download data objects as raw files or with metadata, embedded in JSON.

* `baton-put`_

  Upload local files to create data objects.

* `baton-list`_

  Print the paths, metadata and access control lists and timestamps of
  collections and data objects.

* `baton-metamod`_

  Add or remove specfic :term:`AVU` s in the metadata on collections
  and data objects.

* `baton-metaquery`_

  Print the paths, metadata and access control lists of collections
  and data objects matching queries on metadata.

* `baton-do`_

  Perform a mixture of "list", "chmod", "get", "put", "metamod" and
  "metaquery" ``baton`` operations specified by arguments supplied as
  JSON.

  ``baton-do`` supports additional operations currently unavailable in
  the other programs, namely: "remove" (remove a data object), "mkdir"
  and "rmdir" (create and remove collections, optionally recursively).

All of the programs are designed to accept a stream of JSON objects,
one for each operation on a collection or data object. After each
operation is complete, the programs may be forced flush their output
(See the ``--unbuffered`` command line option.) to ease their use in
bidirectional communication via Unix pipes.

For details of how errors are handled, see :ref:`representing_errors`.


baton-chmod
-----------

.. code-block:: sh

   $ jq -n '{collection: "/unit/home/user",                            \
                access: [{owner: "public", level: "null"},  \
                         {owner: "admin",  level: "own"}]}' | baton-chmod --recurse

   $ jq -n '{collection: "/unit/home/user", data_object: "a.txt"          \
                 access: [{owner: "oscar",  level: "read"},    \
                          {owner: "victor", level: "write"}]}' | baton-chmod

Options
^^^^^^^

baton-get
---------

Synopsis:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ jq -n '{collection: "/unit/home/user/", data_object: "a.txt"}' | baton-get

   $ jq -n '{collection: "/unit/home/user/", data_object: "a.txt", \
             directory: "/data/user/local" }'                      | baton-get --save

   $ jq -n '{collection: "/unit/home/user/", data_object: "a.txt", \
             directory: "/data/user/local",  file: "a_copy.txt"}'  | baton-get --save

This program accepts JSON objects as described in
:ref:`representing_paths` and prints results in the same format. The
target path must represent a data object. Its default mode is to JSON
encode the file content under the JSON property ``data`` in the output.

Some local path properties may be omitted from the input JSON and will
be inferred from the iRODS paths. If the ``file`` property is omitted,
the local file will take its name from the data object. If the
``directory`` property is omitted, the current working directory will
be used for any saved downloads.

``baton-get`` performs an on the-the-fly MD5 checksum of the data
object content as it processes. It compares this with the expected MD5
checksum held in iRODS and will raise an error if they do not
match. The program does not verify the checksum of the file(s) after
they have been written to disk.

Options
^^^^^^^

.. program:: baton-get
.. option:: --acl

  Print access control lists in the output, in the format described in
  :ref:`representing_path_permissions`.

  Print AVU lists in output, in the format described in
  :ref:`representing_path_metadata`.

.. program:: baton-get
.. option:: --connect-time <integer>

   The duration in seconds after which a connection to iRODS will be
   refreshed (closed and reopened between JSON documents) to allow
   iRODS server resources to be released. Optional, defaults to 10
   minutes.

baton-put
---------

Synopsis:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ jq -n '{collection: "/unit/home/user/", data_object: "a.txt", \
             directory: "/data/user/local",  file: "a_copy.txt"}'  | baton-put

This program accepts JSON objects as described in
:ref:`representing_paths` and prints results in the same format. The
JSON must dsecribe a local file to upload and a target data object
path to write. The target path may be an existing object, in which
case it will overwrite.

``baton-put`` performs an on the-the-fly MD5 checksum of the local
file content as it is uploaded. It compares this with the eventual MD5
checksum held in iRODS and will raise an error if they do not
match.

Options
^^^^^^^

.. program:: baton-put
.. option:: --connect-time <integer>

   The duration in seconds after which a connection to iRODS will be
   refreshed (closed and reopened between JSON documents) to allow
   iRODS server resources to be released. Optional, defaults to 10
   minutes.

.. program:: baton-put

  Print verbose messages to STDERR.

.. program:: baton-put
.. option:: --verify

  Calculate and register a server-side checksum and verify the
  uploaded data object against a client-side calculated checksum (like
  the ``-K`` option of ``iput``).

.. program:: baton-put
.. option:: --version

  Print the version number and exit.


baton-list
----------

Synopsis:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ jq -n '{collection: "/unit/home/user/"}' | baton-list

   $ jq -n '{collection: "/unit/home/user/", data_object: "a.txt"}' | baton-list

This program accepts JSON objects as described in
:ref:`representing_paths` and prints results in the same format. If
the target path is a data object, the printed result is also a data
object. However, if the target path is a collection, the printed
result is a JSON array of JSON objects containing one object
representing the target collection followed by one for each collection
or data object directly within the target.

baton-metaquery
---------------

Synopsis:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ jq -n '{avus: []}' | baton-metaquery

   $ jq -n '{collection: "/unit/home/user", avus: []}' | baton-metaquery

   $ jq -n '{avus: [{attribute: "x", value: "y"}]}' | baton-metaquery

baton-do
-------------

Synopsis:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ jq -n '{"operation": "metaquery",
             "arguments": {
                 "avu": true,
                 "acl": true,
                 "replicate": true,

                                {attribute: "m", value: "n"}]}' | baton-do

This program accepts JSON objects as described in :ref:`representing_paths`
that have been wrapped in an additional JSON envelope describing a operation
to be carried out, along with any parameters for that operation.

The JSON envelope has two mandatory properties; `operation`, whose
value must be a string naming a ``baton`` operation to be performed
(one of `checksum`, `chmod`, `get`, `put`, `list`, `metamod`,
`metaquery`, `move`) and `target` which must be a ``baton``-format
JSON object. The envelope has one optional property `arguments` which,
if present, must be a JSON object whose keys and values may be any of
the command line options permitted for the standard ``baton`` clients
supporting the previously named operations. Where command line options
are boolean flags, a JSON `true` value should be used.

.. _representing_paths:

Representing data objects and collections
=========================================

Data objects and collections are represented as JSON objects. A
collection is identified by the ``collection`` property or its shorter
synonym ``c``. For example, the current iRODS working collection may
be represented by either of:

.. code-block:: json

   {"collection": "."}
   {"coll": ""}

.. warning:: Relative paths in iRODS are dangerous!

iRODS 3.x - 4.1.x have a bug which means that a client's current
working collection may, in rare cases, change without notice.

See https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/2406

As a consequence, ``baton`` rejects all relative paths, unless the
``--unsafe`` command line argument is given.

The value associated with the ``collection`` property may be any iRODS
path, absolute or relative, in UTF-8 encoding. A trailing slash on
collections is permitted. This behaviour is different from iRODS
icommands which do not recognise collections specified with a trailing
slash:

.. code-block:: json

  {"collection": "/unit/home/user/λ/"}
  {"collection": "/unit/home/",
     "contents": [{"collection": "/unit/home/user/λ/"}]}

A collection's contents may be represented by the ``contents``
property. This is a JSON list which contains JSON objects representing
other collections and data objects. A ``contents`` property on a data
object JSON object has no meaning and will be ignored.

A data object is identified by having both a ``collection`` (or
``coll``) property and a ``data_object`` property or its shorter
synonym ``obj``. For example, a file in the current iRODS working
collection may be represented by either of:

.. code-block:: json

  {"collection:" "/unit/home/user", "data_object": "README.txt"}
  {"coll:" "/unit/home/user", "obj": "README.txt"}

The value associated with the ``data_object`` property may be any
iRODS data object name, in UTF-8 encoding. The full path of the data
object may be recreated by concatenating the ``collection`` and
``data_object`` values. Data objects reported by listing or searches
will may information on the file size under the ``size`` property. The
value is a JSON integer indicating the file size in bytes as given in
the ICAT database. If checksum reporting has been requested, data
object checksums are given under the ``checksum`` property.

.. code-block:: json

  {"collection:" "/unit/home/user", "data_object": "README.txt", "size": 123456}

The above JSON representations of collections and data objects are
sufficient to be passed to baton's ``baton-list`` program, which
fulfils a similar role to the iRODS ``ils`` program, listing data
objects and collection contents.

``baton`` ignores JSON properties that it does not recognise, therefore it
is harmless to include extra properties in program input.

.. _representing_replicates:

Representing replicates
=======================

In cases where data objects have replicates, the full details of
replication may be displayed, including replicate identity numbers,
status (valid or invalid), resource name, location and checksum.

.. code-block:: json

  {"collection": "/unit/home/user", "data_object": "README.txt",
   "replicates": [{"checksum": "2ebec02316ddc3ee64a67c89b5e3140c",
                   "location": "unit-a-1",
                   "resource": "test_resource",
                   "number": 0,
                   "valid": true}]}

.. _representing_local_paths:

Representing Local Paths
========================

Copies of data objects on a filesystem local to the client are
represented as JSON objects. A directory is identified by the
``directory`` property or is shorter synonym ``dir``.

For example, the current working directory may be represented by
either of:

.. code-block:: json

   {"directory": "."}
   {"dir": "."}

The value associated with the ``directory`` property may be any path,
absolute or relative, in UTF-8 encoding.

A file is identified by having both a ``directory`` (or ``dir``)
property and a ``file`` property. For example, a file in the current
working directory may be represented by either of:

.. code-block:: json

  {"directory:" ".", "file": "README.txt"}
  {"dir:" ".", "file": "README.txt"}

The value associated with the ``file`` property may be any iRODS data
object name, in UTF-8 encoding. The full path of the local file may be
recreated by concatenating the ``directory`` and ``file`` values.

A JSON object may have both iRODS path and local path properties,
thereby indicating a mapping between a data object and a local
file. The ``data_object`` and ``file`` values are not required to be
identical.

.. code-block:: json

Representing metadata
=====================


.. _representing_path_metadata:

Metadata on data objects and collections
----------------------------------------

Metadata attribute/value/units tuples are represented for both
collections and data objects as a JSON array of objects under the
``avus`` property. Each :term:`AVU` JSON object within the array must
have at least an ``attribute`` and a ``value`` property. A ``units``
property may be used where an :term:`AVU` has defined units. The
values associated with all of these properties are strings. These
properties have shorter synonyms ``a``, ``v`` and ``u``, respectively.

.. code-block:: json

   {"collection": "/unit/home/user",
          "avus": [{"attribute": "a", "value": "b", "units": "c"},
                   {"attribute": "m", "value": "n"},
                   {"attribute": "x", "value": "y", "units": "z"}]}

   {"coll": "/unit/home/user",
    "avus": [{"a": "a", "v": "b", "u": "c"},
             {"a": "m", "v": "n"},
             {"a": "x", "v": "y", "u": "z"}]}


Any path that has no metadata may have an ``avus`` property with an
empty JSON array as its value.


.. _representing_query_metadata:

Metadata queries
----------------

This format for :term:`AVU` s is used both in reporting existing
metadata and in specifying baton queries. In the latter case a JSON
:term:`AVU` object acts as a selector in the query, with multiple
:term:`AVU` s being combined with logical ``AND`` and the comparison
operator defaulting to ``=``. As with the iRODS ``imeta`` program,
units are ignored in queries.

For example, the following JSON may be passed to the baton
``baton-metaquery`` program:

.. code-block:: json

   {"avus": [{"attribute": "a", "value": "b", "units": "c"},
             {"attribute": "x", "value": "y"}]}

This is equivalent to a query using the iRODS ``imeta`` program of::

  a = b and x = y

In cases where the ``=`` operator is not appropriate, an additional
``operator`` property may be supplied to override the default. The
available operators are:

* ``=``
* ``like``
* ``not like``
* ``in``
* ``>``
* ``n>`` (numeric coercion)
* ``<``
* ``n<`` (numeric coercion)
* ``>=``
* ``n>=`` (numeric coercion)
* ``<=``
* ``n<=`` (numeric coercion)

The ``in`` operator requires that the attribute's value in the query
be a JSON list of possible strings to test. A successful match will be
any metadata having one of those strings as a value for that
attribute. e.g.

.. code-block:: json

   {"avus": [{"attribute": "a", "value": ["a", "b", "c"], "operator": "in"}]}

To modify the above query to return results only where the attribute
``x`` has values numerically less than 100, the JSON :term:`AVU` would
become:

.. code-block:: json

   {"avus": [{"attribute": "a", "value": "b", "units": "c"},
             {"attribute": "x", "value": "100", "operator": "n<"}]}

This is equivalent to a query using the iRODS ``imeta`` program of::

  a = b and x n< y

The shorter synonym ``o`` may be used as an alternative operator
property so that the query above becomes:

.. code-block:: json

   {"avus": [{"a": "a", "v": "b", "u": "c"},
             {"a": "x", "v": "100", "o": "n<"}]}


A query specified may include a ``collection`` property. The effect of
this is to both direct the query to a specific zone and possibly to
limit results to items contained in a specific collection. This
property allows queries to different zones to be mixed in the input
stream to a single invocation of the query program.

To direct the query to a specific zone, only the zone portion of the
path is required:

.. code-block:: json

  {"avus": [{"a": "a", "v": "b"}],
   "coll": "/public"}

This will direct the query to the ``public`` zone. If the query
program has been started with a ``--zone`` argument explicitly, that
will take precedence over the zone provided in the query.

To limit results to a specific collection:

.. code-block:: json

  {"avus": [{"a": "a", "v": "b"}],
   "coll": "/public/seq/a/b/c"}

This will limit query results to those with AVU ``a = b`` located in
the collection '/public/seq/a/b/c'. Beware that this type of query may
have significantly poor performance in the ICAT generated SQL.


.. _representing_timestamps:

Representing timestamps
=======================

The ICAT database records timestamps indicating when collections and
data objects were created and last modified. These are represented for
both collections and data objects as a JSON array of objects under the
``timestamp`` property. Each timestamp within the array must have at
least a ``created`` or a ``modified`` property. The values associated
with these properties are `ISO8601 datetime strings
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601>`_. These properties have
shorter synonyms ``c``, ``m``, respectively.

.. code-block:: json

   {"collection": "/unit/home/user",
    "timestamps": [{"created":  "2014-01-01T00:00:00"},
                   {"modified": "2014-01-01T00:00:00"}]}

Data objects may have replicates in iRODS. Where data object
timestamps are reported by ``baton``, the values for all replicates are
reported. The replicate number is given in the timestamp object as a JSON
integer.

.. code-block:: json

   {"collection": "/unit/home/user",
    "data_object": "foo.txt",
    "timestamps": [{"created":  "2014-01-01T00:00:00", "replicate": 0},
                   {"modified": "2014-01-01T00:00:00", "replicate": 0}]}


.. _representing_query_timestamps:

Timestamp queries
-----------------

The format described in :ref:`representing_timestamps` is used in both
reporting existing timestamps and in refining baton metadata queries.
In the latter case a timestamp acts as a selector in the query, with
multiple timestamps being combined with logical ``AND`` and the
comparison operator defaulting to ``=``. Time ranges may be queried by
using multiple timestamp objects having the same key (``created`` or
``modified``).

In most cases the the ``=`` operator is not appropriate and additional
``operator`` property should be supplied to override the default. The
available operators are described in
:ref:`representing_query_metadata`. The numeric coercing operators are
preferred because the ICAT database stores timestamps as seconds since
the epoch.

For example, to limit query results to anything created on or after
2014-01-01, the syntax would be:

.. code-block:: json

   {"timestamps": [{"created": "2014-01-01T00:00:00", "operator": "n>="}]}

To limit query results to anything created before 2014-01-01 and
modified in 2014-03, the syntax would be:

.. code-block:: json

   {"timestamps": [{"created":  "2014-01-01T00:00:00", "operator": "n<"},
                   {"modified": "2014-03-01T00:00:00", "operator": "n>="},
                   {"modified": "2014-03-31T00:00:00", "operator": "n<"}]}

.. _representing_permissions:

Representing Access Control Lists
=================================


.. _representing_path_permissions:

ACLs of data objects and collections
------------------------------------

:term:`ACL` s are represented for both collections and data objects as
a JSON array of objects under the ``access`` property. Each JSON
:term:`ACL` object within the array must have at least an ``owner``
and a ``level`` property.

.. code-block:: json

   {"collection": "/unit/home/user",
        "access": [{"owner": "user",   "zone": "unit", "level": "own"},
                   {"owner": "public", "zone": "unit", "level": "read"}]}

The value associated with the ``owner`` property must be an iRODS user
or group name. The value associated with the ``level`` property must
be an iRODS symbolic access level string (i.e. "null", "read", "write"
or "own"). Permissions read from iRODS will also have a ``zone``
property, indicating the zone to which the owner belongs.


.. _representing_query_permissions:

ACL queries
-----------

The format described in :ref:`representing_permissions` is used in
both reporting existing permissions and in refining baton metadata
queries. In the latter case an ACL acts as a selector in the query.

To limit query results to anything owned by ``user1``, the syntax
would be:

.. code-block:: json

   {"access": [{"owner": "user1", "level": "own"}]}

However, care is required; there are two important points to bear in
mind when composing ACL queries:

1. The ICAT database queries will match exact permissions only and
   will not return results for items whose permissions are subsumed
   under the query permission. For example, a query for items for
   which user ``user1`` has permissions ``read`` will not return any
   items where ``user1`` has permissions ``read-write`` or ``own``,
   despite the fact that the latter subsume ``read``.

2. Only one permission clause per user may be included in the
   query. This is because ICAT combines queries using ``AND`` which,
   combined with its limitations described above, would yield queries
   that always return an empty set. E.g. the following query will
   never return any results:

.. code-block:: json

   {"access": [{"owner": "user1", "level": "own"},
               {"owner": "user1", "level": "read"}]}


.. _representing_errors:

Representing Errors
===================

When an error occurs while processing a particular JSON object in a
stream, instead of printing the usual result object, the input JSON
object is printed to standard output with an ``error`` property added
to it. The value associated with this property is a JSON object that
includes the iRODS error code under a ``code`` property and (where
possible) and an error message under a ``message`` property.

.. code-block:: json

   {"collection": "test",
         "error": {"code": -310000,
                   "message": "Path '/unit/home/user/test' does not exist (or lacks access permission)"}}

In this way, errors remain associated with the inputs that caused
them.


The ``baton`` Cookbook
======================

``baton`` benefits from the `lightweight command-line JSON processor
'jq' <http://stedolan.github.io/jq/>`_ . In the following examples,
``jq`` is used to ease the *de novo* creation of JSON in the shell and
to process the results returned by ``baton``.
