	[Upcoming]

	[4.1.0]
	
	Add iRODS 4.2.12 to test matrix.
	
	Fix struct initialisation for metadata operations (affects iRODS
	4.2.12).

	[4.0.1]

	Fix missing format string in logging which caused a segfault when
	log message arugments contained a printf placeholder.

	[4.0.0]

	Improve connection management by closing the connection while
	waiting for the next JSON document and reopening when required.

	[3.3.0]

	Fix ability to list the checksum of an object with a bad replica.

	Add iRODS 4.2.11 to test matrix.

	Improve signal handling so that iRODS connections are closed
	before exiting.

	Fix a segfault caused by irods error values being returned as if
	they were the number of bytes read when a user did not have
	permission to get an object.

	[3.2.0]

	Fix a segfault when the file specified by the -f/--file option was
	absent.

	Fix null checksum handling. A JSON null value can legitimately be
	returned on checksum verification e.g. where the server has not
	created a checksum for the data object.

	Fix for the baton-do "get" operation; the "raw" and "save" options were
	not being passed.

	Fix for the baton-do "get" operation; the JSON sub-document
	decsribing the result was not being returned.

	[3.1.0]

	Add support for iRODS 4.2.10. Remove iRODS 4.2.8 and 4.2.9 from
	tests.

	Remove conda-forge from Conda channels used to build and run.

	Add get_client_version and get_server_version functions.

	Use get_server_version to allow checksum verification tests to be
	skipped on older servers which do not support it.

	iRODS 4.2.9 makes some API changes which are accommodated here, while
	retaining backward compatibility with previous 4.x versions.

	The most significant change is the addition of the ability to select
	"good" replicates i.e. at-rest on the server. Previously we were able
	only to select "newly created" replicates i.e. those which were not
	stale, but which could be in-flight. This change in iRODS was made
	possible by adding object locking to the server.

	The API features for the old-style "newly created" replicates are
	marked as deprecated and redirect to API for "good" replicates on
	iRODS >= 4.2.9.

	Add default of creating checksums to checksum_data_obj if no operation
	is specified.

	[3.0.1]

	Skip the test that always fails on iRODS <4.2.9 due to iRODS bug
	https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/5400.

	Default to replResc resource in the iRODS environment file.
	Print test log on failure.

	Bugfix: Set PKG_CONFIG_PATH to allow configure to find libcheck.

	Bugfix: free memory correctly after the "checksum" operation.

	[3.0.0]

	Add a --verify flag to baton-put and "verify" to baton-do "put"
	operations. This validates the uploaded file against a checksum
	provided by the client. The client should provide a default
	checksum algorithm, otherwise it will fall back to iRODS' default.
	The checksum and verify options are mutually exclusive.

	No longer force checksum re-caculation in baton_json_checksum_op.

	Change signature of put_data_obj to add iRODS default resource.

	Change option_flags enum order.

	Change return type of checksum_data_obj.

	Remove iRODS 4.1.12 from the test matrix.

	Bugfix: double free for query input when listing checksums of a
	dataobject that has inconsistent checksums.

	[2.1.0]

	Bugfix: Added a workaround for iRODS issue
	https://github.com/irods/irods/issues/5072. The workaround
	requires creating a new connection for every put operation when
	baton is re-using a connection for multiple operations. The
	workaround will be active only if baton is compiled the configure
	flag --enable-put-workaround.

	Bugfix: exit non-zero when the iRODS plugins cannot be located.

	Bugfix: segfault when operations require a path and none supplied.

	Add iRODS 4.2.8 to the test matrix.

	Check for both libirods_common and libirods_client for iRODS 4.2.x.

	Use the available replication resource in the test server Docker
	image, rather than manually irepl to another local resource.

	Use check library from Conda, rather than building from source.

	[2.0.1]

	Bugfix: correct cases where we simply returned the target JSON as
	an operation result. A result should always be a freshly created
	JSON struct so that the caller knows how to free it.

	Bugfix: add checks to free rods_path.rodsObjStat
	consistently. Although valgrind didn't find errors with the
	existing checks, they were not applied consistently.

	[2.0.0]

	This release includes changes to the JSON returned by baton-do
	that are not backwardly compatible.

	Ensured that all operations return a JSON document describing the
	target, even in cases where the target was deleted.

	JSON object and JSON array results now appear under distinct
	keys to allow automatic unmarshalling by Go.

	Timestamps are now formatted as RFC3339, which is the default for
	Go unmarshalling.

	Add support for iRODS 4.2, ended full support for iRODS 3.x.

	Add a --connect-time CLI option to limit connection duration.

	Add a --no-error CLI option to baton-do

	Add a remove data object operation.

	Add a create and remove collection option (with recursion).

	Add the ability to optionally create and return checksums on put.

	Add stricter checks on the incoming JSON to help identify errors.

	Switch to using Conda for baton dependencies during tests.

	Switch to using iRODS running in Docker for tests.

	Refactor the list_checksum function to avoid updating the
	checksum.

	Bugfix: fix bug where settings from AC_CHECK_LIBs were reset.

	Bugfix: use json_to_collection_path for collection operations.

	Bugfix: add missing error initialisation and missing error
	code checks.

	Bugfix: handle paths and file names named '0' correctly in the
	Perl wrapper script.

	[1.2.0]

	Bugfix: ensure args_copy.path is defined during error handling.

	Add --wlock command line argument to baton-put and baton-do,
	enabling server-side advisory locking.

	Fix llvm build warnings (Joshua Randall).

	Documentation updates.

	[1.1.0]

	Add --single-server CLI option to allow the user to prevent
	direct access to resource servers when uploading files.

	[1.0.1]

	Restore the --save CLI option of baton-get

	[1.0.0]

	This release includes C API changes that are not backwards compatible.

	Add the baton-put command-line program.

	Add baton-do command-line program.

	Add new move and checksum operations.

	Deprecate baton-metasuper program.

	Use FindBin in baton wrapper script.

	[0.17.1]

	Relink with iRODS 4.1.10.

	Use disposable-irods 1.2.

	[0.17.0]

	Bugfix: Check for errors when closing data objects.

	Add --version CLI argument to baton Perl script.

	Allow baton to report the location of files in compound resources.

	[0.16.4]

	Bugfix: an incorrect error code could be returned in JSON
	responses.

	Bugfix: the root collection '/' was incorrectly identified as
	a relative path.

	[0.16.3]

	Add support for user#zone syntax in permissions.

	Add baton-specificquery program (contributed by Joshua
	C. Randall <jcrandall@alum.mit.edu>).

	Add new autoconf macro ax_with_irods.

	Test on iRODS 4.1.8.

	[0.16.2]

	Bugfix: handle replicates that have no checksum.

	[0.16.1]

	Bugfix: search operators "n>=", "n<=" were not being accepted by
	user input validation.

	[0.16.0]

	Bugfix: baton-metamod was missing its --unsafe CLI option.

	Report data object resource and location for replicates when
	the --replicate option is used.

	Improve error messages.

	[0.15.0]

	Add a --checksum option to the CLI of baton-list and
	baton-metaquery which allows data object checksums to be reported.

	Add reporting of a user's or group's zone to results obtained
	when querying permissions.

	Support for iRODS 4.0.x discontinued.

	[0.14.0]

	Bugfix: fixed queries on ACLs across zones returning no results.

	Add support for iRODS 4.1.x. Support for 4.0.x is temporarily
	suspended until after the release of iRODS 4.1.0.

	Add a safe mode requiring the use of absolute iRODS paths. This
	is the default and may be disabled by using the --unsafe command
	line argument.

	Add a convenience Perl script 'baton' to generate baton-format
	JSON for input to the C programs (as an alternative to using
	'jq').

	Add libtool version information to the shared library.

	[0.13.0]

	Queries for timestamps and no longer limited to replicate '0'' and
	timestamps for all replicates are reported, rather than just the
	most recent.

	[0.12.0]

	Add support for the 'NOT LIKE' and 'IN' query
	operators. Contribution from Joshua Randall.

	Add --with-irods=/path/to/irods option to the configure script.

	[0.11.1]

	Add a --buffer-size option to baton-get. This enables the data
	transfer buffer size to be set by the user.

	[0.11.0]

	Add baton-get program to allow data to be downloaded as files
	or inline JSON.
