	[Upcoming]

	Bugfix: Added a workaround for iRODS bug ###. The workaround
	requires creating a new connection for every put operation when
	baton is re-using a connection for multiple operations. The
	workaround will be active only if baton is compiled with iRODS
	versions 4.2.7 or 4.2.8.

	Bugfix: exit non-zero when the iRODS plugins cannot be located.

	Bugfix: fix segfault when operations require a path and none
	supplied.

	[2.0.1]

	Bugfix: correct cases where we simply returned the target JSON as
	an operation result. A result should always be a freshly created
	JSON struct so that the caller knows how to free it.

	Bugfix: add checks to free rods_path.rodsObjStat
	consistently. Although valgrind didn't find errors with the
	existing checks, they were not applied consistently.

	[2.0.0]

	This release includes changes to the JSON returned by baton-do
	that are not backwardly compatible.

	Ensured that all operations return a JSON document describing the
	target, even in cases where the target was deleted.

	JSON object and JSON array results now appear under distinct
	keys to allow automatic unmarshalling by Go.

	Timestamps are now formatted as RFC3339, which is the default for
	Go unmarshalling.

	Add support for iRODS 4.2, ended full support for iRODS 3.x.

	Add a --connect-time CLI option to limit connection duration.

	Add a --no-error CLI option to baton-do

	Add a remove data object operation.

	Add a create and remove collection option (with recursion).

	Add the ability to optionally create and return checksums on put.

	Add stricter checks on the incoming JSON to help identify errors.

	Switch to using Conda for baton dependencies during tests.

	Switch to using iRODS running in Docker for tests.

	Refactor the list_checksum function to avoid updating the
	checksum.

	Bugfix: fix bug where settings from AC_CHECK_LIBs were reset.

	Bugfix: use json_to_collection_path for collection operations.

	Bugfix: add missing error initialisation and missing error
	code checks.

	Bugfix: handle paths and file names named '0' correctly in the
	Perl wrapper script.

	[1.2.0]

	Bugfix: ensure args_copy.path is defined during error handling.

	Add --wlock command line argument to baton-put and baton-do,
	enabling server-side advisory locking.

	Fix llvm build warnings (Joshua Randall).

	Documentation updates.

	[1.1.0]

	direct access to resource servers when uploading files.

	a relative path.

	[0.16.2]

	the --replicate option is used.

	Add support for iRODS 4.1.x. Support for 4.0.x is temporarily

	is the default and may be disabled by using the --unsafe command
	line argument.

	JSON for input to the C programs (as an alternative to using
	'jq').

	Add libtool version information to the shared library.

	timestamps for all replicates are reported, rather than just the
	most recent.

	operators. Contribution from Joshua Randall.

	Add --with-irods=/path/to/irods option to the configure script.
